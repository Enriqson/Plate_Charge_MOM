# Plate Charge Method Of Moments

Calculates the charge distribution of 2 square conductive plates using the Method Of Moments and uses the result to calculate the capacitance between the plates, comparing it to an analytical result.

Project is in many different formats, html and pdf suitable for reading the annotations (all in portuguese though).
